all testing done in sandbox or bot matches with -insecure startup flag to allow sv_cheats 1 and reshade
in theory if VAC is active you wont be able to join public matches like this. I have no tested so its very possible there is no VAC protection this early. Do not think this makes it safe or acceptable to abuse this info in matches. Sure you might not catch an autoban but if you do something stupid and obvious like hiding walls you'd better hope there arent any streamers on the enemy team
